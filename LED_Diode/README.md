Usage: `python -W ignore -u "c:\Users\spyre\Downloads\PhysLabs\script.py"`

Repo Contains:

- Both the original, unfiltered excel sheet and cleaned modularized .CSVs from the Light Emitting Diode Behavior Lab.

- Code to generate a Polynomial regression with an `a*x^p+b` objective.

- Code to plot color-coded scatterplots and regressions

- Code to automatically install necessary dependencies via `pip` if they are not already installed

- Outputs:

  1. A .txt containing the regressions found in a human-friendly view.
